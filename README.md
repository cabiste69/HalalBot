# HalalBot

This is a discord bot that replaces the audio in videos / make videos (1min long) out of images using halal music called nasheed (a type of music that only contains human speech).

this a simple version of the bot written in python on termux and nano (had nothing better to do)

# how to use

1. create a token.txt file that contains your bot's token
2. open `main.py` and edit the `nasheedPath` variable to set the path for your halal audio
3. run it with `python main.py` (after installing the dependencies ofc)
